- Last session: Completed main.js implementation
- Current task: Build pages/learning-path.html
- Priority: üî• CRITICAL
- Estimated time: 8 hours
- Files to create: frontend/pages/learning-path.html

I understand the documentation requirements:
1. Update CC-CHECKPOINT.md after session
2. Update CC-TASKS.md when complete
