# Claude Code Rules for RF-Hub Project

## Purpose

These rules ensure maintainability, traceability, and project continuity. Documentation updates are **CRITICAL** to avoid confusion and duplicate work.

**MUST** rules are non-negotiable; **SHOULD** rules are strongly recommended.

5. Resume work only after docs are accurate

### If You Can't Find Information

1. Check docs/00-READ-THIS-FIRST.md for orientation
2. Check FILE-STRUCTURE.md for file locations
3. Check TODO-MASTER.md for task context
4. Check CC-CHECKPOINT.md for recent work context
5. If still unclear, note question in CC-CHECKPOINT.md for Anthony

### If You Encounter a Blocker

1. Document blocker in CC-CHECKPOINT.md immediately
2. Update task status to ‚è∏Ô∏è Blocked in TODO-MASTER.md
3. Note blocking reason and what's needed to unblock
4. Identify alternative tasks that can be done
5. Update Anthony via checkpoint file
