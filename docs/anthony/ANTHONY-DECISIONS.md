## üéØ PENDING DECISIONS

### üî• CRITICAL - Backend Technology (Blocking Multiple Tasks)

**Date Raised:** October 8, 2025  
**Decision Deadline:** October 10, 2025  
**Priority:** CRITICAL

**Decision Needed:** Choose backend technology stack

**Options:**

**Option A: Firebase (Google)**
- ‚úÖ Fast setup (3-5 days)
- ‚úÖ Built-in authentication
- ‚úÖ Real-time database sync
- ‚úÖ Free tier generous (50k reads, 20k writes per day)
- ‚úÖ Hosting included (Firebase Hosting)
- ‚úÖ Good documentation
- ‚ùå Vendor lock-in (harder to migrate later)
- ‚ùå NoSQL limitations for complex queries
- ‚ùå Less control over infrastructure

**Option B: Node.js + PostgreSQL**
- ‚úÖ Full control over everything
- ‚úÖ SQL power for complex queries
- ‚úÖ No vendor lock-in
- ‚úÖ Open source
- ‚úÖ Better for large scale (future)
- ‚ùå Longer setup time (7-10 days)
- ‚ùå Need separate auth system (Passport.js or similar)
- ‚ùå More maintenance required
- ‚ùå Separate hosting needed (DigitalOcean, AWS, etc.)

**Impact:**
- **Blocks:** User authentication, progress tracking, quiz system, all interactive features
- **Affects:** 8+ tasks in TODO-MASTER
- **Timeline:** Firebase = launch 1-2 weeks earlier

**Research Done:**
- Claude provided comparison in this chat
- Database schema designed for both (07-DATABASE-SCHEMA.md)

**Considerations:**
- How quickly do we want to launch?
- How important is avoiding vendor lock-in?
- What's our technical comfort level?
- Do we plan to scale to 10,000+ users?

**My Current Thinking:**
[Your thoughts here - lean toward Firebase? PostgreSQL? Undecided?]

**Decision:** [PENDING]  
**Date Decided:** [TBD]  
**Rationale:** [Your reasoning when decided]

**Action Items After Decision:**
- [ ] Notify Claude (finalize schema)
- [ ] Notify CC (begin implementation)
- [ ] Update TODO-MASTER.md priorities
- [ ] Update PROGRESS-TRACKER.md

## ‚úÖ DECISIONS MADE

### Documentation Structure Overhaul

**Date Decided:** October 8, 2025  
**Decision:** Approved multi-file documentation system

**Options Considered:**
1. Keep single massive file (rf_learning_context.MD)
2. Split into multiple focused files (CHOSEN)

**Rationale:**
- Single file was becoming unmanageable (10,000+ lines)
- Claude Code had to read entire doc to find tasks
- No recovery system for chat interruptions
- New system provides:
  - Clear task separation
  - Chat interruption recovery
  - Contributor-specific workspaces
  - Better scalability

**Impact:**
- All contributors now use new workflow
- Saves ~6 hours/week per contributor
- Professional project management structure

**Files Created:**
- 17 documentation files
- 3 workspace folders
- Checkpoint system implemented

**Repository:** https://github.com/unmanned-systems-uk/RF-Hub.git

**Rationale:**
- Transparency and open development
- Community contributions welcome
- Portfolio showcase
- Learning resource for others

**License:** [To be decided - see pending decisions]
