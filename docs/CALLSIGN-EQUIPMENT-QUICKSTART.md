## Files Created/Modified

### ‚úÖ New Files Created:
1. `/backend/migrations/add_callsign_equipment.sql` - Database migration
2. `/backend/models/Equipment.js` - Equipment data model
3. `/backend/routes/equipment.js` - Equipment API routes
4. `/docs/CALLSIGN-EQUIPMENT-IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Full documentation

### ‚úÖ Modified Files:
1. `/backend/models/User.js` - Added call sign methods
2. `/backend/routes/auth.js` - Added call sign lookup endpoint

---

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Run the Database Migration

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Run the migration
psql -d rf_learning_hub -f migrations/add_callsign_equipment.sql

# Verify tables were created
psql -d rf_learning_hub -c "\dt"
```

Expected new tables:
- `user_equipment`
- `equipment_presets`
- `equipment_setups`
- `ai_equipment_suggestions`

### Step 2: Restart the Backend Server

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
# Start server
npm start
```

You should see the equipment routes registered.

### Step 3: Test the New Endpoints

```bash
# Get enhanced profile with equipment stats
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/auth/profile/full

# Add a call sign
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/auth/profile \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "call_sign": "M0ABC",
    "call_sign_country": "United Kingdom",
    "call_sign_license_class": "Full"
  }'

# Get equipment presets

## Future AI Integration Examples

### Scenario 1: HackRF + Airband Antenna
**AI Suggestion:**
```
Activity: Monitor Air Traffic Communications
- Connect HackRF to airband antenna
- Launch SDR++
- Set frequency to 118-137 MHz
- Configure AM mode
- Tune to local airport tower frequency
- Listen to pilot-ATC communications
```

### Scenario 2: VHF Transceiver + No Training
**AI Suggestion:**
```
Module Recommendation: Complete Module 2.1 - VHF/UHF Basics
- Learn about VHF frequency allocations
- Understand repeater operations
- Study proper calling procedures
Before transmitting, make sure you understand VHF band plans!
```

### Scenario 3: Multiple Antennas
**AI Suggestion:**
```
Experiment: Compare Antenna Performance
- Use your HackRF to measure received signal strength
- Compare your dipole vs. vertical antenna
- Record RSSI values on different frequencies
- Create a performance chart
Related Module: 3.2 - Antenna Fundamentals
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Migration fails with "relation already exists"
**Solution:** Tables may already exist. Drop them first:
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ai_equipment_suggestions CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS equipment_setups CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS equipment_presets CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_equipment CASCADE;
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS call_sign CASCADE;
```

**Issue:** Equipment routes return 404
**Solution:** Make sure server.js includes the equipment routes:
```javascript
const equipmentRoutes = require('./routes/equipment');
app.use('/api/equipment', equipmentRoutes);
```

**Issue:** Can't add equipment - validation error
**Solution:** Ensure required fields are provided:
- `equipment_type` (required)
- `model` (required)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks:
1. ‚úÖ Run database migration
2. ‚úÖ Test backend endpoints
3. üî≤ Create frontend profile page
4. üî≤ Create frontend equipment page
