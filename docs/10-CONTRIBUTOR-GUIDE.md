## üéØ Decision-Making Process

### Decision Types

**Strategic Decisions** (Anthony)
- Backend technology choice
- Monetization strategy
- Domain name
- Major feature additions
- Budget allocations
- Launch timing

**Technical Decisions** (Claude + Anthony approval)
- Database schema design
- API endpoint structure
- Security implementations
- Integration approaches

**Implementation Decisions** (Claude Code)
- Code structure
- Library choices (within approved list)
- Styling details
- Component design

### Decision Framework

**For any significant decision:**

1. **Research:** Gather information (Claude if needed)
2. **Document:** Create entry in appropriate decisions log
3. **Options:** List alternatives with pros/cons
4. **Impact:** Identify what's affected
5. **Discuss:** If needed, create dedicated chat
6. **Decide:** Anthony makes call for strategic, others for their domain
7. **Document:** Record decision and rationale
8. **Communicate:** Update affected tasks and notify team via docs
9. **Execute:** Assign follow-up tasks

**Decision Speed Guidelines:**
- Critical blocking decisions: Within 48 hours
- High priority decisions: Within 1 week
- Medium priority: Within 2 weeks
- Low priority: As time allows

---

## üí¨ Communication Protocols

### Primary Communication: Documentation

**All communication happens through docs:**
- TODO-MASTER for task assignments
- Checkpoint files for active work
- PROGRESS-TRACKER for status updates
- Decision logs for choices made
- Chat conversations for complex discussions

**Benefits:**
- Asynchronous (work anytime)
- Documented (nothing lost)
- Searchable (find past discussions)
- Clear (no ambiguity)

---

### When to Create a New Chat

**Create separate chats for:**
- Major features ("3 - Authentication System")
- Complex research ("4 - Advanced Phased Array Theory")
- Separate topics ("5 - Marketing Strategy")
- Troubleshooting specific issues ("Debug - Mobile Nav")

**Keep in main chat for:**
- Quick updates
- Clarifications
- Daily coordination
- File structure changes
- Quick questions

**Chat Naming Convention:**
```
[Number] - [Topic Name]
Examples:
1 - RF-Learning-Hub webpage management (main)
2 - Backend Tech Research
3 - Authentication System Implementation
4 - Deployment & Launch
```

---

### Chat Continuity Protocol

**THE CHECKPOINT RULE:**  
Before ANY substantial work, create a checkpoint.

**When to Checkpoint:**
- Starting a new task (even small ones)
- Every 30 minutes during complex work
- Before switching topics
- When chat feels long (200+ lines)
- Before asking CC to implement something
- When making important decisions

**Checkpoint Format:**
```markdown
## [TIMESTAMP] - [NAME] Checkpoint

**Current Task:** [What you're working on]
**Status:** [% complete]
**Completed:** [What's done]
**In Progress:** [Current activity]
**Next Steps:** [What's left]
**If Interrupted:** [How to resume]
**Files Modified:** [List]
**Blocking Issues:** [Any problems]
```

**Recovery Process (If Chat Interrupted):**
1. Check relevant checkpoint file
2. Read ACTIVE CHECKPOINT section
3. Create recovery chat with context
4. Resume from "Next Steps If Interrupted"
5. Update checkpoint after completion
