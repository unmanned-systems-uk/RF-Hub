## 🎓 LEARNING INSIGHTS

### What's Working Well
- New documentation structure is much clearer
- Collaboration with Claude and CC is effective
- VNA measurements are improving understanding
- Equipment investment was worthwhile

### What Needs Improvement
- Need to be more consistent with daily documentation
- Should test features sooner (mobile issues could have been caught earlier)
- Need to make decisions faster (backend choice has been pending)

### Lessons Learned
- Documentation is crucial - one massive file wasn't sustainable
- Chat interruptions can lose context - checkpoint system is smart
- Professional project management makes everything smoother
- Having clear tasks and priorities reduces decision fatigue
